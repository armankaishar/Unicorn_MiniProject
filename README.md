## 💡Motivation

As you stand on the threshold of your first project in our data analytics training program, remember that this is more than just an assignment; it's your first step into the vast, dynamic world of data-driven decision-making. This project is your canvas to apply the theories and techniques we've explored so far to real-world scenarios, transforming abstract concepts into tangible outcomes. You'll navigate through the complexities of data, wielding your analytical tools not just to find answers, but to ask **better questions**. This endeavor will challenge you, pushing you to think critically, problem-solve creatively, work in a team, and communicate your findings effectively. The skills and insights you gain here will be the building blocks of your professional journey in the ever-evolving landscape of data analytics.

### 🎬 Introduction

---

This mini-project will combine what you have learned in the preceding units on SQL, Spreadsheets, and Tableau. 

The project includes 4 main parts, each with their subtasks:

1. Data Exploration by SQL
2. Data Cleaning using Spreadsheets
3. Getting Insights using Tableau
4. Executive summary and presentation

### 🦄 Project Background

---

The online sector has been slowly eating up market share in the past two decades. E-commerce platforms like **Unicorn** allow people to buy products online: from books, toys, clothes, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household items. The following dataset includes Unicorn sales data from the years 2015-2018.

Let's suppose that the Unicorn is a family business and is owned by 2 stakeholders who are very invested in their business. They already have a small data analytics team but want to expand it significantly over the next few months. They see you as a candidate for a DA position and provide you with a sample dataset from their sales data.

Your task is to analyze the data, find interesting insights, and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost its business growth 🚀.

### 🧹Project Logistics

---

The project is divided into 4 parts:

1. Explore a Unicorn data sample organized into a database with four tables. Answer predefined questions employing SQL.
2. Explore a unified dataset (.csv file) in Spreadsheets. Use your knowledge from the current unit to analyze and visualize the data while finding interesting insights.
3. Use Tableau to perform exploratory data analysis and pull unique insights from the dataset. Create a dashboard that will dynamically present the findings.
4. Make a one-page report with main insights and recommendations. Record a 5-minute presentation of your findings.
